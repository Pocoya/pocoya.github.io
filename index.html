    <h1>Helpful Tips for Effective Studying</h1>
    <p>Studying is essential if you want to perform well
        in school and pass important tests. While we all recognize
        the importance of studying, sometimes it can be difficult
        to put effective study methods into practice. This is a
        universal problem among students and test-takers. As an
        expert in test preparation, we are here to share some
        beneficial study tips that can help you develop a strong
        foundation to perform well on your exams.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="second-page-col">
            <h3>Tip 1</h3>
            <p>An easy way to ensure that your shorter study
                sessions remain concise and effective is to have
                a specific study goal. Instead of overloading your
                brain with a large variety of information, it is
                better to focus on learning a specific concept.
                This helps to improve retention and confidence in
                that particular subject. It is also important to
                reward yourself when you complete these goals!
                Allow yourself to take a break, spend time with
                friends or treat yourself to a snack. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-page-col">
            <h3>Tip 2</h3>
            <p>Another way to better understand the topics
                you're studying is to teach them to others.
                Explaining a concept aloud will strengthen your
                understanding of that concept and your ability
                to recall the details. While this is a great
                exercise to do with fellow classmates and friends,
                you can also teach to an imaginary audience. It
                doesn't matter who you explain the material to, as
                long as you have the ability to explain it. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-page-col">
            <h3>Tip 3</h3>
            <p>In order to help with neural retention, it is
                beneficial to find your “special” study place. Try
                to find a quiet space where you can be alone and
                focus on studying without distractions. Whether it's
                the library, a coffee shop, your room or elsewhere,
                keep track of which locations inspire the most
                productivity. Once you've established these locations
                as designated study spaces, your brain will register
                that it's time to focus and become more receptive to
                new information. </p>
