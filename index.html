    <p><br>Researchers believe that your motivation to study can either come <br>
        from inside you or outside of you. You can be motivated by an internal <br>
        drive to learn as much possible. Or, you might be motivated to study <br>
        by an external reward like a good grade, or a great job, or someone <br>
        promising you a car. Recently, researchers have discovered that your <br>
        motivation to study is rooted in lots of factors, many of which we have <br>
        control over. Rory Lazowski of James Madison University and Chris Hulleman <br>
        of the University of Virginia analyzed more than 70 studies into what <br>
        motivates students in schools. They published their paper, “Motivation <br>
        Interventions in Education: A Meta-Analytic Review, in the journal Review <br>
        of Educational Research. Lazowski and Hulleman found that a number of ways<br>
        to improve motivation consistently yield positive results. Here, I describe<br>
        seven of the techniques that you can most readily use on your own to power<br>
        through your own study barriers, and move your learning forward. <br>
        You may think to yourself, “My goal is to graduate and get a good job and <br>
        be rich.” While that's a fine ambition, by itself it probably won't help <br>
        you in school day-to-day. In order to improve your motivation to study, <br>
        your goals have to be a little closer to home. In fact, setting clear <br>
        academic goals has been scientifically linked to higher grade point averages <br>
        than students who set vague goals, like, “I'll just do the best I can.” <br>
        Set a goal to earn an “A” on a particular test in a particular subject. Or, <br>
        decide to learn everything you can about a concept because it will help you<br>
        in the real world. Set a deadline for homework that will force you to finish<br>
        a task before it is due so you can review it before handing it in. Whatever<br>
        the goal is, be sure it is specific, relevant, and timely. </p><br>
